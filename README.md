# PyFractalFlame
This project implements the algorithm found in Scott Draves' paper available at http://flam3.com/flame.pdf.

This is going to be an eventual re-write of my C version of this project.  Currently a work in progress, trying different methods to use multi-threading in Python to evauluate performance, resource use, and easier management of config files for rendering fractals.
